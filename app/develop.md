Dolt is a single-node and embedded DBMS that incorporates Git-style versioning as a first-class entity. Dolt behaves like Git where it is a content addressable local database where the main objects are tables instead of files. In Dolt, a user creates a repository locally. The repository contains tables that can be read and updated using SQL. Similar to Git, writes are staged until the user issues a commit. Upon commit, the writes are appended to permanent storage.
